## Authentication and Considerations for the future
- currently there is no authentication but this security feature must be considered in the event that this API is exposed to the public. 
- logging agent must be considered currently to minimize the dependencies a logger lik Log4j was not installed but upon deployment to AWS, and productionizing this api this must be added.
- Alerting also must be added in the event of true failures or service downing adding an alerting service like pager duty should be considered.
- NOTE spark was upgraded to latest version to support a controller.
- The optimal infrasturcture on AWS should be considered based off the average TPS. We have a few options:
      - We could deploy this as an EC2 with ECS tasks with an alb in front and r53. Downside to this would be cost
      - We could use a lambda and ALB in the event we have a lower TPS and are not concerned with latency on cold starts. downside is scalability.
      - Finally we have the next serverless solution that maybe the most optimal is a fargate api with alb infront. This is a happy medium with the cost and cold start latency.



## Error Handling
All error handling is handled serverside and input validations are conducted each route details the proper inputs in the documentation.
